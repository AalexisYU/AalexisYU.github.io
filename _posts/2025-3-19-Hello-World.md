title: PHYS 3130 Project Data with Jekyll Blog!
---

Greetings readers, this is my first blog post. As the Winter 2025 semester winds down, one of my physics courses has me creating a blog, and I find that a very intriguing change of pace. Nonetheless, this post in particular will be dedicated to my PHYS3130 - Practical Data Science Methods course's final project part 1.
