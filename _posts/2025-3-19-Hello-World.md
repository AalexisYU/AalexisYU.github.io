title: PHYS 3130 Project Data with Jekyll Blog!
---

Greetings readers, this is my first blog post. As the Winter 2025 semester winds down, one of my physics courses has me creating a blog, and I find that a very intriguing change of pace. Nonetheless, this post in particular will be dedicated to my PHYS3130 - Practical Data Science Methods course's final project part 1.

The data I selected for the project is from the NEOWISE dataset, one containing over 2TB of data Essentially, this data is of all the discovered near-Earth orbit objects that could be compiled. Despite the massive size, however, the scale of the data was reduced to three datasets with 1309 objects, called "either.csv", another called "cbe.csv" with 693 objects, and the final "pms.csv" with 8470 objects. In total, 10,472 objects are included. This data was chosen as I have a particular interest in space and astronomy, and such a dataset was very interesting to read through and examine. One of the properties of the NEOWISE data was albedo, or the light reflectiveness from the surface of one of the objects. (A. Mainzer and Maleszewski, 2011) utilized this same database to categorize the objects based on that property, which I found particularly interesting.
